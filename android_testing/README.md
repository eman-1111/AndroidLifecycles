# Android Testing Codelab

This folder contains the source code for the Android testing codelab. It gives an introduction into testing on Android, including unit tests and UI tests.

Mobile applications run on devices that vary greatly in screen size and resolution, processing power, available memory or connectivity. Manually testing your application across all these different device configurations and external factors can be sheer impossible - that's where automated testing can help.

The [Android Testing Support library](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/) (ATSL) provides a great framework for testing your Android app. It has a JUnit 4-compatible test runner ([AndroidJUnitRunner](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/testing-support-library/index.html#AndroidJUnitRunner))
and functional UI testing through [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/testing-support-library/index.html#Espresso) and [UI Automator](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/testing-support-library/index.html#UIAutomator). You can run tests for these APIs directly in the Android Studio IDE or from the command line, which makes it very easy to integrate them into your development flow.
